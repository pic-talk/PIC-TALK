In this study, developing open-source technology and establishing an ecosystem -PICÂ­-TALK- with the vision of the obliteration of inconveniences in the educational life of visually impaired individuals and contribution to their adaptation to the social life is intended.

## The Goal of The Project
The purpose of our project; it is necessary to remove the difficulties encountered by visually impaired individuals in their educational life and to contribute to social life adaptations. It is to develop an open, integrated technological product for developers and developers.


## WHAT WE ABLE TO DO
- Shape Display: For sensing any shape of anything you want. (8x8)
- Smart-Wristband: For sensing colors and feeling any image from computer or mobile platforms
- Computer & Mobile Application: Learning information about images, reading books, drawing pictures etc.
- Website: Can interact with all the systems and developers can contribute to the community with website.

## OUR MOTIVATION

- This system is the first open-source technology platform in the world for visually impaired individuals.
- It will decrease the cost of the products




## PRODUCTS

### Shape Display

Our purpose is to make 8x8 shape display that illustrates figures or graphs to visually impaired individual.
